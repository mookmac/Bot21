# Bot21 - a chatbot assistant to help you run better 1-2-1 meetings with your team

My hack is a chatbot that is designed to help line managers run effective 1-2-1 meetings with their employees. It tracks objectives for each employee via a simple-to-use adaptive card interface, and then leverages AI to suggest talking points for the meeting based on the employee's objectives. It can also summarise and store meeting notes for later recall.

Some functionality is incomplete or a bit tempremental (largely down to needing some more rigourous testing of the AI prompts!) but hopefully this project demonstrates the intention to blend pre-defined actions with the power of AI to provide contextual responses.

The chatbot is configured to use Azure Blob storage so that key information is retained between conversations.

## Prerequisites

- OpenAI API key
- Azure Blob Storage

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure by following these steps:

| From Visual Studio Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | From TeamsFx CLI                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

  1. Select `Launch Remote (Edge)` or `Launch Remote (Chrome)` from the launch configuration drop-down.
  1. Press the Play (green arrow) button to launch your app - now running remotely from Azure.

- From TeamsFx CLI: execute `teamsfx preview --env dev` in your project directory to launch your application.

## Validate manifest file

To check that your manifest file is valid:

- From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select: `Teams: Validate Application`.
- From TeamsFx CLI: run command `teamsfx validate` in your project directory.
