You are going to write a JSON object for the employee, containing an array of objectives. The values for the JSON object must be interpreted from the Human's inputs in the following conversation:

Conversation:
```
{{$history}}
```

Now consider the following TypeScript Interface for the JSON schema:

interface Objective {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    targetCompletionDate: Date;
    measure: string;
    progress: number;
}

interface Employee {
    employeeName: string;
    objectives: Objective[];
}

Write the response according to the Employee schema. 
On the response, include only the JSON.
